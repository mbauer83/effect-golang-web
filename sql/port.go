package sql

// What this package needs of a database, and no more.
//
// Three operations and a cursor. database/sql is itself an abstraction over
// drivers, so a second one earns its place only because pgx's native interface
// is not database/sql: an adapter for either fits behind this, and an
// application that depends on it depends on neither.

// Querying is a database, or a transaction on one. The two answer the same
// operations, which is what lets a repository be written once and run either
// way.

// Beginning is a database that can start a transaction. A transaction cannot,
// which is why this is separate: nested transactions are a different feature
// with different semantics, and a type that offered one it does not have would
// be lying.

// Cursor walks a result set one row at a time, so a large one need not be held.

	// Row is the current row, as the named values it is.
	Row() (dynamic.Object, error)
	// Err is why the walk stopped, if it was not the end.

	// Close releases the rows. It is called by the stream that owns the cursor.
