// One of the two places this module holds a value it cannot name.
//
// database/sql scans into any and a driver hands back any, because a driver
// cannot know what a column holds until it reads it. That is a genuine boundary
// rather than a shortcut, and it is confined to this file: everything above it
// works in the universal representation, which has a case for each of the seven
// kinds a driver may produce.
//
// The architecture test names this file and the other one, so each exemption is
// a decision on the record rather than a hole someone widened.
