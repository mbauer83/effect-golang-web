# DDL reference

`schema/ddl` projects an aggregate's description into the tables that hold it.

```go
statements, err := ddl.Create(ddl.Postgres, PalletSchema.Structure())
statements, err := ddl.Drop(ddl.MySQL, PalletSchema.Structure())
tables, err := ddl.Tables(ddl.Postgres, PalletSchema.Structure())  // as data
```

## An aggregate is not one table

An object with an **identity** is an entity and gets a table of its own. An
object without one is a **value** belonging to whatever holds it, and lives in
that thing's row. So a pallet with a list of items projects to two tables and
the foreign key between them, while the warehouse it sits in is a column.

That is the finding [§7.2](../../architecture-plan.md#72-prior-art-a-previous-attempt-at-exactly-this)
records, and a table-per-declaration design would have got it wrong.

The tables come back **parent first**, which is the order the statements have to
run in: a child cannot reference a table that is not there yet. `Drop` reverses
it.

The child carries what it needs and nothing more:

- a reference column named for its parent and that parent's key — `Pallet_id`;
- a **cascading** foreign key, because a child entity has no life without its
  root and a row that outlived its parent would be unreachable;
- an **index** on it, because looking a parent's children up is a question the
  schema itself asks;
- a `position` column when the field was a **list**, because a list is ordered
  and a table is not — without it, the list read back would not be the list
  written.

Those last two are derived, so a description that already has a column of that
name is **refused** rather than getting two or one silently overwritten.

## The three dialects

`Postgres` and `MySQL` are what this is for. `MySQL` covers MariaDB, which
agrees about everything here. `SQLite` is a third, and a deliberate one: it runs
everywhere these tests run, so the derivation can be *executed* rather than
compared to expected strings.

They are not one dialect with different keywords:

| | Postgres | MySQL | SQLite |
|---|---|---|---|
| unbounded text | `text` | `longtext` | `text` |
| bounded text | `varchar(n)` | `varchar(n)` | `text` |
| boolean | `boolean` | `tinyint(1)` | `integer` |
| bytes | `bytea` | `longblob` / `varbinary(n)` | `blob` |
| instant | `timestamptz` | `datetime(6)` | `text` |
| document | `jsonb` | `json` | `text` |
| generated key | `bigint generated always as identity` | `bigint not null auto_increment` | `integer` |
| now | `current_timestamp` | `current_timestamp(6)` | `(strftime(…))` |

Some of those choices are load-bearing rather than stylistic. `timestamptz`
because an instant without a zone is a time nobody can place. `datetime(6)`
rather than MySQL's `timestamp`, which is bounded by 1970 and 2038 and rewritten
into the session's time zone — and with the precision spelled out, because
`current_timestamp` without it fills a `datetime(6)` to the second and loses the
microseconds silently. `engine=innodb default charset=utf8mb4` because MySQL's
defaults have changed between versions, and a schema that did not say would mean
different things on two servers. SQLite's identity is a plain `integer` because
a column of that type which is the sole primary key **is** an alias for the
rowid, so it is assigned when a row is inserted without one.

## What is refused, and why refusing beats guessing

| refused | because |
|---|---|
| an object with no identity | its rows could not be found again |
| an unnamed object | a name taken from the field holding it would change when that field did |
| a computed column with no default | a column with no value and no default is one no row can be written for, and an invented default is a rule nobody asked for |
| an identity with parts, or one that may be absent | an identity is one value, and one that may be absent identifies nothing |
| a derived column colliding with a declared one | two columns of one name, or one silently overwritten |
| **Postgres**: an unsigned 64-bit column | Postgres has none, and a decimal that held the values would not be an integer — a key that was fast would quietly stop being one |
| **MySQL**: an unbounded string *key* | MySQL rejects a TEXT column in a key specification outright, and a prefix length invented here would make two different keys equal whenever they agreed for that many characters |

The small unsigned types are **widened** rather than refused on Postgres —
`uint8` to `smallint`, `uint32` to `bigint` — because every value still fits and
the column is still an integer. That is not approximating.

A map of entities is stored as one document column rather than becoming a table,
because the key would need a column and the description does not say what to
call it. Inventing a name would put it in the schema forever.

## Defaults

`Computed` says a value is not the caller's; that is all a
[derived shape](variant.md) needs. A table needs the other half, so the
description says it:

```go
schema.FieldOf("storedAt", schema.Time(), get, set).Computed().DefaultingToNow()
schema.FieldOf("status", schema.Text(), get, set).Defaulting(dynamic.OfText("new"))
```

A closed set — a value or *now* — rather than a SQL string, because a string
would be one dialect's spelling inside a description meant to outlive the choice
of dialect. A generated identity needs none: the database's own key generation
is what produces it.

`on update current_timestamp` is **not** here. MySQL has it and Postgres needs a
trigger, so an `updated_at` that worked on one and silently did nothing on the
other would be worse than not offering it.

## What DDL cannot state becomes a comment

Constraints and formats are emitted as comments. Two enforcements would be two
rules to keep in step, every dialect spells a `CHECK` differently, and the schema
layer already keeps these on the way in and on the way out — so the table says
what it cannot keep.

A bound the **column type already keeps** is left out: a description states the
range its width implies because JSON Schema has no integer widths, but a column
typed `integer` says it in the type, and restating it would be noise that looked
like a rule somebody chose. Exact rather than a guess — only a bound that is
precisely the width's own limit is skipped, so a narrower one the author asked
for survives.

## Not idempotent, deliberately

There is no `if not exists`. It would make the tables skippable and leave the
indexes failing on a second run, because MySQL has no such clause for an index —
a schema that half re-ran would be worse than one that did not. These statements
make a schema once. Changing an existing one is a **migration**, which
[§7.1](../../architecture-plan.md#71-ddl-and-migrations-researched-not-built)
records the approach for and which is not built.

## What the tests establish

The statements are **run**, not compared to strings: against SQLite in the
ordinary suite, where the schema is then asked what it holds — the generated key
is assigned without being given, the default applies with nobody supplying it,
the foreign key cascades, and a child with no parent is refused.

Postgres and MySQL are gated on `EFFECT_GOLANG_POSTGRES_URL` and
`EFFECT_GOLANG_MYSQL_URL`, and run in CI against service containers. Those tests
**skip** where no database is reachable, and a skipped test is not evidence.
[`examples/warehouse`](../../examples/warehouse/warehouse.go) is the aggregate.
