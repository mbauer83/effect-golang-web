// The record of what has been applied.

// One row per aggregate, holding the version its tables are at. Not one row
// per step: a step is derived from the history and the history is code, so what
// a database has to remember is where it got to and not what the steps were.
// That is also what keeps a history editable -- inserting a version between two
// released ones is a code change and not a rewriting of somebody's ledger.
