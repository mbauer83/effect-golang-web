// Everything happens in **one transaction**: the lock is taken, the ledger is
// read, the steps are applied and each is recorded as it completes. Where the
// database has transactional DDL -- Postgres and SQLite -- that makes the whole
// migration atomic, so a failure at the fourth step leaves a database still at
// the version it started from. MySQL commits its DDL as it goes and cannot
// offer that; what it does offer is that the lock is held throughout and the
// ledger says which step was the last to finish, so running again continues
// from there rather than from the beginning.
//
// The first time, the tables are created as of the target and that version is
// recorded -- because a database that starts at 3.0.0 has not skipped anything,
// it simply never had 1.0.0 to alter.
//
// Either direction. A target earlier than the recorded version runs the
// inverses, which is a thing to do knowingly: some of them cannot restore what
