package migrate

// How several instances agree on which of them migrates.
//
// Deliberately small. A lock here is one statement to take it and one to give
// it back, taken on the same connection the migration runs on -- which is what
// a transaction gives -- and nothing else. Leader election, leases and
// heartbeats are somebody else's problem and a much larger one; what this
// closes is the ordinary case of every replica starting at once and all of them
// trying to alter the same table.

// Lock is a database's own advisory lock.
//
// Advisory, so it guards this migration against another instance of the same
// migration and nothing else: it does not stop somebody altering the table by
// hand, and it is not a replacement for one process being responsible.

// PostgresAdvisory takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock.
//
// Transaction-scoped, so Postgres frees it when the transaction ends however it
// ends -- which is exactly what is wanted and one fewer thing to get wrong than
// releasing it by hand. The key is hashed to the bigint the function takes,
// because Postgres's advisory locks are numbered and this one is named.

// by the first ALTER and the next instance could walk in behind it.
