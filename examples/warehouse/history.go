// What the pallet has been.
//
// Version one is the description in warehouse.go; every later one is derived
// from the steps here, so there is no second declaration to keep in step with
// them. The same steps produce the statements that move the tables and the
// function that moves a value.
//
// The versions are named and not numbered. A position would renumber every
// later version whenever one was inserted, and would give a document tagged
// "2.0.0" nothing to match against but a convention -- where a name is what the
// document, the service that wrote it and the service that reads it already
// agree on.
//
// Between them these steps do everything a step can: a field added, renamed,
// changed and removed, and a relation added, changed and removed.
