// A database that records what was asked of it, and a cursor over rows a test

//
// The transaction tests are stated against these rather than against a real
// database, because a database's locking is not a reliable witness to a
// rollback: whether an un-rolled-back transaction blocks the next statement
// depends on the driver, the journal mode and the connection pool, and a test
// that passed for one of those reasons would not be testing this.
