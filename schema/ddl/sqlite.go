// SQLite.
//
// A third dialect, and a deliberate one. Postgres and MySQL are what was asked
// for and neither runs in every place these tests run, so without this the
// derivation -- which tables there are, what the keys are, which column a child
// carries, what order the statements go in -- could only be checked by
// comparing strings to strings. SQLite is already a dependency here, so the
// statements can be *executed* and the schema then asked what it holds.
//
// It is a real dialect and not a stub: what it spells differently, it spells
// differently for reasons.
