// The statements that take an aggregate from one version to the next.
//
// This is where a declared change pays for itself. A rename is a rename --
// "alter table t rename column a to b" -- and the data stays where it is. A
// diff could only have seen a column gone and a column arrived, and the
// statements it wrote would have thrown the column's contents away.
//
// A relation is not a column, so a change to one is not a change to a column: a
// relation added is a table created, one removed is a table dropped, and one
// whose cardinality changed is a column and an index on the child. Which of
// those a change is depends on what the field was, which is why this walks the
// description as it was before each change rather than only the changes.
