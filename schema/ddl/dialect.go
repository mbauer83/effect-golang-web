// Dialect is one database's spelling.
//
// Narrow on purpose: a dialect resolves a scalar to its own type, names the
// generated-identity form, quotes an identifier, and says whether it can put a
// document in a column. Everything else about a table -- which tables there
// are, what the keys are, which columns a child carries -- is the description's
// and is the same everywhere.
