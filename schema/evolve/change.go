// What can happen between two versions.
//
// A closed set of four, and the set is the point. A rename is a member of it,
// which is the whole reason this is declared rather than diffed: a diff sees a
// column gone and a column arrived and cannot tell a rename from a
// drop-and-add, so the most developed tool in the TypeScript ecosystem asks
// interactively and its programmatic path cannot do it at all. Declared, it is
// simply known.

// switches over it and knows it has covered everything, and so a step cannot

// a table that has rows in it.
