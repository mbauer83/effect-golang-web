package evolve

// The change the closed set cannot express.
//
// Four changes derive their own value migration, because a rename moves a
// member and an addition fills one and a removal drops one, and none of that
// needs a function. What they cannot do is compute: a field split into two, two
// merged into one, a count that was text becoming a number, metres becoming
// millimetres. Those need somebody to say how, in both directions, and there is
// no deriving it.
//
// So this carries the how. It is one change rather than an option on the
// others, because a change that recomputes values is a different kind of thing
// from one that moves them -- and because the four staying derivable is what
// keeps the ordinary case free of functions nobody had to write.

//
// The structural part is said in the ordinary four -- a split is two additions
// and a removal -- and it is said in **two lists**, because a computation needs
// both ends present while it runs. The targets have to exist before the values
// move, and the sources cannot go until after: a split that dropped the old
// column first would be computing from a column that is not there, which is a
// mistake this shape makes unmakeable rather than one an author has to remember
// not to make.
//
// Going back reverses the two lists as well as the two directions, so the same
// declaration reads correctly in both: the source is put back, the values move,
// and the targets go.
